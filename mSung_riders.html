The only rider in history to win 125, 250, 500 and MotoGP™ World Championships, Rossi dominated MotoGP™ with first Honda and then Yamaha, taking the crown five times in a row until Nicky Hayden won the title in 2006. Back on top in 2008 and 2009, the Italian was then beaten to the crown by teammate Jorge Lorenzo in 2010 and left to join the factory Ducati Team. After three podiums over a tough two seasons, the rider from Tavullia was back at Yamaha for 2013 and took his first win in three years in Assen.</td>

Valentino Rossi is a 9-time World Champion and 2018 will be his 23rd season in the World Championship. The only rider in history to win 125, 250, 500 and MotoGP™ World Championships, Rossi dominated MotoGP™ with first Honda and then Yamaha, taking the crown five times in a row until Nicky Hayden won the title in 2006. Back on top in 2008 and 2009, the Italian was then beaten to the crown by teammate Jorge Lorenzo in 2010 and left to join the factory Ducati Team. After three podiums over a tough two seasons, the rider from Tavullia was back at Yamaha for 2013 and took his first win in three years in Assen. Runner up in the title in 2014, Rossi then fought for his tenth crown in 2015 but was beaten in the final race by Lorenzo once again. 2016 has seen more pole positions, podiums and race wins and saw the Italian runner up once again; remaining with Movistar Yamaha MotoGP for 2017 with new teammate Maverick Viñales. Another win, at the Dutch GP at the TT Circuit Assen, was the jewel in another successful season – but struggles for the team with low grip and a broken leg sustained in training just before Misano put a damper on the latter half of the year. Rossi impressed to come back from his injury after only three weeks, however, and took another podium before the end of the year, coming second in the awesome showdown at Phillip Island. For 2018, the Italian remains with Yamaha – and remains hungry to win.</p>
